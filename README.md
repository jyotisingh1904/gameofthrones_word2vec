Word2Vec Analysis of Game of Thrones Dataset 🐉👑
Explore the fascinating world of Game of Thrones using Word2Vec! This project showcases how deep learning models can extract meaningful relationships from text, unveiling hidden connections between characters, locations, and objects in Westeros. ⚔️📖

Project Overview 📜
This project uses the Word2Vec model to analyze a Game of Thrones text dataset. By creating word embeddings, we uncover semantic relationships and contextual associations between words, giving insights into the fictional universe of Westeros.

Key Features:
Text Preprocessing:

Cleaned and tokenized the Game of Thrones text dataset for training. 🧹📜
Word2Vec Training:

Leveraged the Gensim library to train a Word2Vec model on the dataset.
Generated word embeddings representing semantic meanings and relationships. 🤖✨
Exploration:

Analyzed word similarities to discover relationships like:
"Arya" being closely associated with "Needle" and "faceless".
Highlighted connections between characters, locations, and objects. 🎯
Why Word2Vec? 🌟
Word2Vec is a deep learning model that maps words into a high-dimensional vector space. It captures:

Semantic meanings.
Contextual relationships.
Hidden groupings within text data.
This makes it a perfect choice for analyzing complex fictional universes like Game of Thrones.
